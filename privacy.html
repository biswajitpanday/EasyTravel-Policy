        <p>This policy explains what information we collect when you use Easy Travel’s sites, services, mobile applications, products, and content (“Services”). It also has information about how we store, use, transfer, and delete that information. Our aim is not just to comply with privacy law. It’s to earn your trust.</p>

          <a><h4 class="post-subtitle">Information We Collect & How We Use It</h4></a>
        </div>
        <p>Easy Travel does make money from ads. So we collect data in order to advertise to you. The tracking we do at Easy Travel is to make our product work as well as possible.</p>
        <p>In order to give you the best possible experience using Easy Travel, we collect information from your interactions with our network. Some of this information, you actively tell us (such as your email address, which we use to track your account or communicate with you). Other information, we collect based on actions you take while using Easy Travel, such as what pages you access and your interactions with our product features (like highlights, follows, and applause). This information includes records of those interactions, your Internet Protocol address, information about your device (such as device or browser type), and referral information.</p>
        <p>We use this information to: </p>
        <div>
          <ul>
            <li>provide, test, improve, promote and personalize Easy Travel Services</li>
            <li>fight spam and other forms of abuse</li>
            <li>generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how people use Easy Travel Services</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>When you create your Easy Travel account, and authenticate with a third-party service (like Twitter, Facebook or Google) we may collect, store, and periodically update information associated with that third-party account, such as your lists of friends or followers. We will never publish through your third-party account without your permission.</p>

        <div class="post-preview">
          <a><h4 class="post-subtitle">Information Disclosure</h4></a>
        </div>
        <p>Easy Travel won’t transfer information about you to third parties for the purpose of providing or facilitating third-party advertising to you. We won’t sell information about you.</p>
        <p>We may share your account information with third parties in some circumstances, including: (1) with your consent; (2) to a service provider or partner who meets our data protection standards; (3) with academic or non-profit researchers, with aggregation, anonymization, or pseudonomization; (4) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process; (5) when we have a good faith belief that doing so will help prevent imminent harm to someone.</p>
        <p>If we are going to share your information in response to legal process, we’ll give you notice so you can challenge it (for example by seeking court intervention), unless we’re prohibited by law or believe doing so may endanger others. We will object to requests for information about users of our services that we believe are improper.</p>

          <a><h4 class="post-subtitle">Data Storage</h4></a>
        </div>
        <p>Easy Travel uses third-party vendors and hosting partners, such as Amazon, for hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology we need to run Easy Travel. We maintain two types of logs: server logs and event logs. By using Easy Travel Services, you authorize Easy Travel to transfer, store, and use your information in the United States and any other country where we operate.</p>

        <div class="post-preview">
          <a><h4 class="post-subtitle">Third-Party Embeds</h4></a>
        </div>
        <p>Some of the content that you see displayed on Easy Travel is not hosted by Easy Travel. These “embeds” are hosted by a third-party and embedded in Easy Travel. For example: YouTube or Vimeo videos, Imgur or Giphy gifs, SoundCloud audio files, Twitter tweets, GitHub code, or Scribd documents that appear within a Easy Travel post. These files send data to the hosted site just as if you were visiting that site directly (for example, when you load a Easy Travel post page with a YouTube video embedded in it, YouTube receives data about your activity). Easy Travel does not control what data third parties collect in cases like this, or what they will do with it. So, third-party embeds on Easy Travel are not covered by this privacy policy. They are covered by the privacy policy of the third-party service.</p>
        <p>Some embeds may ask you for personal information, such as your email address, through a form. We do our best to keep bad actors off of Easy Travel. However, if you choose to submit your information to a third party this way, we don’t know what they may do with it. As explained above, their actions are not covered by this Privacy Policy. So, please be careful when you see embedded forms on Easy Travel asking for your email address or any other personal information. Make sure you understand who you are submitting your information to and what they say they plan to do with it. We suggest that you do not submit personal information to any third-party through an embedded form.</p>
        <p>If you embed a form that allows submission of personal information by users, you must provide near the embedded form a prominent link to an applicable Privacy Policy that clearly states how to you intend to use any information collected. Failure to do so may lead Easy Travel to disable the post or take other action to limit or disable your account.</p>

          <a><h4 class="post-subtitle">Tracking & Cookies</h4></a>
        </div>
        <p>We use browser cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you return to our Services. We use them in various ways, for example to log you in, remember your preferences (such as default language), evaluate email effectiveness, allow our paywall and meter to function, and personalize content and other information.</p>
        <p>Easy Travel doesn’t track you across the Internet. We track only your interactions within the Easy Travel network (which encompasses Easy Travel.com and custom domains hosted by Easy Travel).</p>
        <p>Some third-party services that we use to provide the Easy Travel Service, such as Google Analytics, may place their own cookies in your browser. This Privacy Policy covers use of cookies by Easy Travel only and not the use of cookies by third parties.</p>
        <p>Easy Travel complies with the “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) standard recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium. For logged-out users browsing with DNT enabled, Easy Travel’s analytics will not receive data about you, but we will do some first-party tracking in order to customize content and provide data to third-party service providers that enable Easy Travel Services to work. When you use Easy Travel while logged-in to your account, we cannot comply with DNT. Here’s some more information about Easy Travel’s Do Not Track policy.</p>
